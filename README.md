# curls
## Completely Unsupervised Reinforcement Learning Server

Control reinforcement learning training and visualization via REST API.  This is (clearly) a work in progress.

You can, however, install it using pip:
`pip install curls`

To build from this repo, the recommended approach would be to build a Python 3.6 environment using Anaconda:
`conda create -n curls python=3.6`

and installing the requirements via pip:
`pip install -r requirements.txt`

A rough diagram of the general idea can be found <a href="/curls/framework/architecture.pdf"> here</a> (note: this diagram is most likely not accurate).
